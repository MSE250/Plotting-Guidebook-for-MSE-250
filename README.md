# Plotting-Guidebook-for-MSE-250

Hello everyone, Jupyter Notebook is a versatile notebook that allows you to write and run Python code directly in your browser. \
\
This Guidebook is designed to be user-friendly. You can easily generate plots by running the provided code snippets.\
\
However, you will need to upload your data for plotting to the folder on the left side, and manually adjust settings such as line colors as required.

Please feel free to read along and execute the code and see how it works.

## How to use

1. Please use the browser to open Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/.

2. Click on the `upload files` in the top left corner to upload the two files from the
compressed package into the same folder.

3. Open `[file name].ipynb` and start running the program from the first block of code (starting from the middle may cause errors). The shortcut for running is: `shift + enter (macOS)`.

## If you encounter any problems:
1. Make sure you have read the tutorial.

2. Ask ChatGPT (ChatGPT is a software expert available 24/7 for your assistance).

3. Use Google to search for your issue; many others may have encountered the same problem.

4. Discuss with others and don't hesitate to experiment (your computer won't explode, probably).

5. Try using other software for data processing, such as Matlab or OriginLab.
