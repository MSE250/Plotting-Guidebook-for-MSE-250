# Plotting-Guidebook-for-MSE-250

Hello everyone, Jupyter Notebook is a versatile notebook that allows you to write and run Python code directly in your browser. \
\
This Guidebook is designed to be user-friendly. You can easily generate plots by running the provided code snippets.\
\
However, you will need to upload your data for plotting to the folder on the left side, and manually adjust settings such as line colors as required.

Please feel free to read along and execute the code and see how it works.

Hello everyone. In this series, we will be guiding you through the essentials of plotting and basic data statistics using Matlab and Jupyter Notebook. 

## Which platform is easier? 
In my opinion, Matlab tends to be more user-friendly for those who are just starting out.

## How to use

### Matlab
You can download Matlab from the official website: `https: //www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/michigan-state-university-1110432.html` \
Alternatively, you can use Matlab online, which is a convenient option. However, be mindful that using Matlab online might present some issues, such as difficulty in accessing local files and occasional performance issues.

### Jupyter Notebook
For those who prefer an online environment, Jupyter Notebook is a great choice. You can access it through this link: `https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/` \
Jupyter Notebook offers a robust, interactive environment for coding and data analysis.

## If you encounter any problems
1. Make sure you have read the Guidebook.

2. Ask ChatGPT (ChatGPT is a programming expert available 24/7 for your assistance).

3. Use Google to search for your issue; many others may have encountered the same problem.

4. Discuss with others and don't hesitate to experiment (your computer won't explode, probably).

5. Try using other software for data processing, such as OriginLab, R, Excel (Not recommended for processing large amounts of data).

### Please read the annotations carefully and follow the instructions provided.
### By adhering to the guidance at every step, the majority of issues you encounter can be resolved with the information found in the annotations.
### However, if you neglect to read the instructions, or only partially follow them, nobody can guarantee a solution to your problems.
