# Plotting-Guidebook-for-MSE-250

Welcome to this quick-start guide! Watching all tutorials won't take more than 10 minutes ☕️.

In this guidebook, we'll empower students with no prior experience in Matlab or Python to swiftly acquire the plotting skills needed for your MSE250 lab reports.

Each folder includes a video tutorial, the code scripts and the relevant data used in the video.

I've made an effort to keep each video concise (30 sec ~ 3 mins), ensuring you get the information you need before running out of patience.

## Which platform is easier? 
In my opinion, Matlab tends to be more user-friendly for those who are just starting out.

## How to download

### Matlab
You can download Matlab from the official website: `https: //www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/michigan-state-university-1110432.html` \
Alternatively, you can use Matlab online, which is a convenient option. However, be mindful that using Matlab online might present some issues, such as difficulty in accessing local files and occasional performance issues.

### JupyterLab
For those who prefer an online environment, JupyterLab is a great choice. You can access it through this link: `https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/` \
JupyterLab offers a robust, interactive environment for coding and data analysis.

## If you encounter any problems

1. Ask ChatGPT (ChatGPT is a programming expert available 24/7 for your assistance).

2. Use Google to search for your issue; many others may have encountered the same problem.

3. Discuss with others and have a try (your computer won't explode, probably).

4. Try using other software for data processing, such as OriginLab, R, Excel (Not recommended for processing large amounts of data).
