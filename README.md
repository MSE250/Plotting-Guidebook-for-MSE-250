# Plotting-Guidebook-for-MSE-250

Welcome to this quick-start guide!

Watching all videos won't take more than 10 minutes ☕️. Each video 30 sec ~ 2 min.

In this guidebook, we'll empower students with no prior experience in Matlab or Python to swiftly acquire the plotting skills needed for your MSE250 lab reports.

## Which platform is easier? 
In my opinion, Matlab tends to be more user-friendly for those who are just starting out.\
But if you want to learn python further in the future, using JupyterLab for plotting is a good start.

## How to download

### Matlab
You can download Matlab from the official website: `https: //www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/michigan-state-university-1110432.html` \
Alternatively, you can use Matlab online, which is a convenient option. However, be mindful that using Matlab online might present some issues, such as difficulty in accessing local files and occasional performance issues.

### JupyterLab
For those who prefer an online environment, online JupyterLab is a great choice. You can access it through this link: `https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/` \
JupyterLab offers a robust, interactive environment for coding and data analysis.

Google Colab is also a good choice (https://colab.research.google.com). The Colab is able to run Jupyter Notebook Script as well. But the GUI and features of Colab follows "Google style", maybe it is easier to use.

## If you encounter any problems

1. Ask ChatGPT，Claude etc. (Both ChatGPT and Claude are programming experts available 24/7 for your assistance).

2. Use Google to search for your issue; many others may have encountered the same problem.

3. Discuss with others and have a try (your computer won't explode, probably).

4. Try using other software for data processing, such as OriginLab, R, Excel (Not recommended for processing large amounts of data or complicated calculations).
